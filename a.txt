Built on Google ADK for strategic A2A protocol alignment, this autonomous multi-agent system leverages Qwen-Plus to orchestrate non-linear research workflows. The architecture, engineered with FastAPI for asynchronous parallel processing, fuses Ali GraphDB for multi-hop supply chain traversal and Ali Bailian for RAG-based document analysis. By automating complex knowledge graph navigation, ITCR transforms a 2-week manual process into a 3-minute operation, visualizing hidden demand via React/D3 and identifying >50% net-new clients previously invisible to sales teams.
