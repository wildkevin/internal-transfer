HSBC Team 1: Data Alliance (Presenter: Galen G W ZHONG; Team: Kevin Y Wang, Levin M H Liu, Alex J Y Tang, Alyson J J Tang, Wing S C Chen) presents the Intelligent Target Client Recommender (ITCR).

Addressing the "Iceberg Problem" of manual sales research, ITCR is an autonomous multi-agent system built on Google ADK and the Qwen-Plus LLM. By orchestrating agents to traverse complex corporate knowledge graphs (Ali GraphDB) and analyze public data, ITCR transforms a 2-week manual process into a 3-minute automated workflow. The system successfully identifies >50% net-new hidden clients deep within supply chains, delivering a scalable, A2A-ready revenue engine.
